# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered invisible debugging and observability extension for VSCode. The extension will automatically collect rich, structured runtime context during code execution and debugging sessions, then leverage AI/LLM integration to provide precise, context-aware error diagnosis and debugging insights. The tool aims to reduce AI hallucinations in debugging workflows while maintaining an invisible, non-intrusive developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using AI coding assistants, I want automatic collection of debugging context so that AI can provide more accurate error diagnosis without manual logging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a debug session starts THEN the system SHALL hook into VSCode Debug API to monitor session events
2. WHEN breakpoints are hit THEN the system SHALL capture variable states and stack traces automatically
3. WHEN exceptions occur THEN the system SHALL collect error messages and full stack traces
4. WHEN console outputs are generated THEN the system SHALL intercept and store log data
5. IF network requests are made THEN the system SHALL capture request/response data through middleware instrumentation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want invisible data collection so that my debugging workflow remains uncluttered and focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug context is collected THEN the system SHALL store data in hidden output channels invisible to normal workflow
2. WHEN the extension is active THEN the system SHALL NOT clutter console outputs or debug views with collection artifacts
3. WHEN toggling AI debug mode THEN the system SHALL provide clear on/off controls without disrupting existing debug UI
4. IF the extension encounters errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking the debug session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI-powered diagnostic insights so that I can quickly understand and resolve complex debugging issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug context is available THEN the system SHALL package data into structured JSON format for LLM consumption
2. WHEN sending to AI services THEN the system SHALL use securely stored API keys provided by the user
3. WHEN AI analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL display insights in a dedicated side panel
4. WHEN multiple LLM providers are available THEN the system SHALL support OpenAI, HuggingFace, and other major APIs
5. IF AI services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or manual trigger capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure handling of sensitive data so that my code and credentials remain protected during AI analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collecting debug data THEN the system SHALL automatically redact authentication tokens and PII
2. WHEN storing API keys THEN the system SHALL use VSCode's secure storage mechanisms
3. WHEN transmitting data to AI services THEN the system SHALL use encrypted connections
4. WHEN users opt-in to telemetry THEN the system SHALL clearly disclose what data is collected and how it's used
5. IF sensitive data is detected THEN the system SHALL provide user controls to exclude specific data types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want minimal performance impact so that debugging sessions remain responsive and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug sessions are active THEN the system SHALL maintain low runtime overhead (< 5% performance impact)
2. WHEN collecting large amounts of data THEN the system SHALL use efficient batching and streaming mechanisms
3. WHEN processing AI requests THEN the system SHALL handle them asynchronously without blocking debug operations
4. IF memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL implement automatic cleanup and data rotation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working with different frameworks, I want extensible middleware support so that the extension works with my technology stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using HTTP libraries THEN the system SHALL provide Axios interceptor examples and documentation
2. WHEN working with different languages THEN the system SHALL support Node.js, Python, and Java debugging protocols
3. WHEN custom instrumentation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear extension points and APIs
4. IF new frameworks emerge THEN the system SHALL allow community contributions for additional middleware

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy installation and setup so that I can start using AI debugging capabilities immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the extension THEN the system SHALL require minimal configuration beyond API key setup
2. WHEN first launching THEN the system SHALL provide clear onboarding with setup instructions
3. WHEN configuring AI providers THEN the system SHALL offer guided setup for major LLM services
4. IF setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive debugging context so that AI can understand the full scope of issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture source code references and line numbers
2. WHEN variables are inspected THEN the system SHALL include variable types, values, and scope information
3. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL capture request headers, payloads, and response details
4. WHEN debugging multi-step processes THEN the system SHALL maintain session correlation across related events
5. IF context is incomplete THEN the system SHALL indicate missing information to the AI service
