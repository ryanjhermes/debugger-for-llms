# AI-Powered Invisible Debugging Extension

An AI-optimized invisible logging and debugging tool for VSCode that automatically collects rich, structured runtime context during debugging sessions and leverages AI/LLM integration to provide precise, context-aware error diagnosis.

## Overview

This extension revolutionizes debugging workflows by:
- **Invisible Context Collection**: Automatically captures debugging data without cluttering your workflow
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Sends structured context to LLMs for intelligent error diagnosis
- **Reduced AI Hallucinations**: Provides comprehensive runtime context for more accurate AI insights
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with Node.js, Python, Java, and popular frameworks
- **Privacy First**: Automatic PII redaction and secure credential management

## Features

- üîç **Automatic Debug Context Collection**: Captures variables, stack traces, console outputs, and network activity
- ü§ñ **Multi-AI Provider Support**: Integrates with OpenAI, HuggingFace, and other LLM services
- üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy & Security**: Built-in data redaction and secure API key storage
- ‚ö° **Performance Optimized**: < 5% overhead on debugging sessions
- üîß **Extensible Middleware**: Support for custom framework instrumentation
- üìä **Clean UI**: Non-intrusive side panel for AI insights and diagnostics
